# AnyDocAI RLS Issues Summary

## Overview

We've investigated the Row Level Security (RLS) issues in the AnyDocAI application and found that the RLS policies themselves are correctly configured in the Supabase database. The issues are primarily in how the authentication is being handled in the application code.

## Key Findings

1. **RLS Policies**: The RLS policies in Supabase are correctly configured and working as expected when tested with the service role key.

2. **Authentication Issues**: We identified several issues in the authentication system:
   - Using service role key for client authentication in `auth_service.py`
   - JWT token may not be handled correctly in `connection_manager.py`
   - JWT token may not be extracted correctly from request in `auth.py`

3. **Frontend Issues**: The frontend may not be correctly passing the JWT token in API requests.

## Root Causes

The main issues appear to be:

1. **Incorrect Key Usage**: Using the service role key when the anon key should be used for client authentication.

2. **JWT Token Handling**: Not properly extracting or passing the JWT token in API requests.

3. **Authentication Flow**: The authentication flow may not be correctly setting up the Supabase client with the user's JWT token.

## Recommended Fixes

### Backend Fixes

1. **Fix `auth_service.py`**:
   - Use the anon key (SUPABASE_KEY) instead of the service role key for client authentication
   - Only use the service role key when absolutely necessary (e.g., for admin operations)

2. **Fix `connection_manager.py`**:
   - Ensure JWT tokens are properly handled and passed in requests
   - Add proper error handling for authentication failures

3. **Fix API Endpoints**:
   - Correctly extract JWT tokens from request headers
   - Use the token to authenticate requests to Supabase

### Frontend Fixes

1. **Supabase Client Initialization**:
   - Use the anon key for client initialization
   - Ensure the client is properly handling the JWT token after login

2. **API Requests**:
   - Ensure the JWT token is included in the Authorization header for all API requests
   - Handle authentication errors properly

## Testing

We've created several scripts to help test and fix these issues:

1. **`scripts/test_rls.py`**: Tests the RLS policies using the service role key
2. **`scripts/fix_rls_policies.sql`**: SQL script to ensure RLS policies are correctly configured
3. **`scripts/fix_auth_service.py`**: Checks for common authentication issues in the backend code
4. **`scripts/FIX_RLS_ISSUES.md`**: Detailed guide on how to fix RLS issues

## Next Steps

1. Run the `fix_auth_service.py` script to identify specific issues in your codebase
2. Follow the recommendations in `FIX_RLS_ISSUES.md` to fix the identified issues
3. Test the fixes using the `test_rls.py` script
4. Test the application to ensure users can access their own data

## Conclusion

The RLS issues in AnyDocAI are primarily related to how authentication is being handled in the application code, not the RLS policies themselves. By fixing the authentication issues, you should be able to resolve the 403 Forbidden errors and ensure that users can access their own data.
