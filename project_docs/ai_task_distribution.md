Whenever a document or user input contains an **image, chart, graph, scanned content**, or even a **screenshot/photo of text**, you'll **route that task to GPT-4-Vision** (aka `gpt-4-vision-preview`) automatically.

### âœ… Example Task Handling Workflow

#### 1. **User Uploads:**
- If they upload a **PDF/DOCX/Excel**:
  - Check if it contains **images, charts, or scanned content**.
  - If **yes** â†’ send image sections to `gpt-4-vision-preview`.
  - If **no** â†’ send full text to `gpt-3.5-turbo` (Free) or `gpt-4-turbo` (Paid).

#### 2. **User Clicks Photo from Phone:**
- Directly route to **`gpt-4-vision-preview`** â€” it's the best model for OCR + reasoning on images.

#### 3. **Email/Resume/Business Card Scan:**
- Use GPT-4 Vision for structure, formatting, and extraction.

### ðŸ§  Smart Tip: Hybrid Processing

Letâ€™s say a document has 5 pages:
- Page 1-3 = plain text â†’ GPT-3.5 or GPT-4
- Page 4 = image of a chart â†’ GPT-4-Vision
- Page 5 = scanned form with handwriting â†’ GPT-4-Vision

You can **split the doc**, route each piece to the right model, then **merge the output** for a seamless chat experience.

### ðŸ”§ Your Routing Logic in Python (Example)

```python
def process_document(doc, user_plan):
    if doc.has_images():
        if user_plan == "free":
            return "Upgrade required for image understanding"
        else:
            return "gpt-4-vision-preview"
    else:
        return "gpt-4-turbo" if user_plan == "paid" else "gpt-3.5-turbo"
```
